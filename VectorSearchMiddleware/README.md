# VectorSearchMiddleware

The **VectorSearchMiddleware** is a Flask-based middleware proxy that provides a REST API to bridge communications between the [Oracle 23ai Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/23ai/) and the [VectorSearchUserInterface](https://github.com/ericwarriner/Oracle23aiVectorSearch/VectorSearchUserInterface). It exposes endpoints for operations such as image retrieval and face encoding, enabling the UI to perform vector-based search and similarity analysis.

## üöÄ Features

- **REST Endpoints:**  
  - **`/hello` (GET):** Retrieves a specified number of image blobs from the database.
  - **`/encode_face` (POST):** Accepts a base64-encoded image, performs face recognition to extract an embedding vector, and queries the Oracle 23ai database for matching entries based on vector distance, age and tolerance filters.

- **Oracle 23ai Integration:**  
  Connects to the Oracle 23ai database using credentials provided via environment variables.

- **Face Recognition:**  
  Uses the `face_recognition` library to generate embedding vectors from images.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Before running this middleware, ensure the following environment variables are set:

```bash
DB_USERNAME="your_db_username"
DB_PASSWORD="your_db_password"
DB_DSN="your_db_dsn"
PORT=8080
```

For example:

```bash
DB_USERNAME=oracle23ai_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DSN=129.153.38.218/freepdb1
PORT=8080
```

These can be exported in your terminal or specified in a local .env file.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:

- `Flask`
- `gunicorn`
- `face_recognition` 
- `numpy`
- `datasets`
- `oracledb`
- `Pillow`
- `python-dotenv`

These can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file.


## üö¢ Deployment

The middleware is containerized using Docker. The provided Dockerfile installs the required dependencies and starts the app using Gunicorn.

To build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t vectorsearch-middleware .
docker run -p 8080:8080 vectorsearch-middleware
```


üîå Integration with VectorSearchUserInterface
The VectorSearchUserInterface communicates with this middleware by making HTTP requests to the exposed endpoints. For example, the /encode_face endpoint is used for processing images and retrieving similar faces from the database.

This middleware ensures secure and efficient communication between the UI and the Oracle 23ai backend, abstracting the complexity of database interactions.

üí° Usage
Set up the required environment variables.
Deploy the middleware (either locally or via Docker).
Configure the user interface to point to the middleware's URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/encode_face).
üõ†Ô∏è Development
To run the middleware locally:
```bash
python [main.py]
```


Make sure your environment variables are configured correctly before starting the server.
