# Vector Search Python Service

This Python project demonstrates vector search capabilities using face recognition and Oracle's 23ai Converged Database. 
It leverages machine learning datasets and processes facial encodings for advanced search and analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Face Recognition**: Detect and compare facial encodings using `face_recognition` and `numpy`.
- **Dataset Handling**: Load and manage datasets with Hugging Face’s `datasets` library.
- **Oracle 23ai Integration**: Connect and interact with an Oracle 23ai Converged Database using `oracledb`.
- **Efficient Search**: Perform fast vector similarity search operations.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:

- `numpy`
- `face_recognition`
- `datasets` (from Hugging Face)
- `oracledb`

These can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before installing the Python packages, ensure the following system dependencies are in place (especially for `face_recognition` which relies on `dlib`):

### Ubuntu / Debian-based Systems
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake
sudo apt-get install -y libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

### Oracle Client (Optional for `oracledb` Thick Mode)
If you're using **thick mode** with `oracledb`, you'll need Oracle Instant Client libraries. See the [Oracle Installation Guide](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html) for more details.

## 🐍 Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vector-search-python-service.git
cd vector-search-python-service
```

### Install Python Dependencies
It’s recommended to use a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

1. Ensure that the environment variables is set. This points to the Oracle 23ai database component responsible for vector encoding.


```bash
DB_USERNAME=""
DB_PASSWORD=""
DB_DSN=""

```

For example:

```bash
DB_USERNAME=oracle23ai_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DSN=129.153.38.218/freepdb1

```


2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```
